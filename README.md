# Buildables Fellowship

Welcome to the **Buildables Fellowship**, a 12-week hands-on journey designed to transform passionate learners into **AI Builders**.  
This fellowship is structured to help participants master **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — from fundamentals to advanced applications like RAG systems, AI agents, and fine-tuning — while building real-world, deployable projects.

---

## Fellowship Overview

Over the course of **12 weeks**, fellows will gain a deep, practical understanding of how to build, deploy, and scale LLM-powered applications.  
Each week focuses on a key aspect of AI development, combining **theory**, **implementation**, and **project-based learning**.
