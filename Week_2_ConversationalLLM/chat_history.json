Below is a basic C++ code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple program that outputs \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Entry point of the program\nint main() {\n    // Output \"Hello, World!\" to the console\n    std::cout << \"Hello, World!\" << std::endl;\n    return 0; // Indicates that the program ended successfully\n}\n```\n\nThis code includes the necessary header file to utilize the input/output stream library, defines the `main` function, and uses `std::cout` to print a string to the console. To run this code, you would need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Please feel free to reach out if you have any specific requirements or further questions."
