    "## 1. How AI Interprets Your Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:**\n",
    "AI doesn’t “think” like humans; it recognizes **patterns and associations** in data. It doesn’t *understand* concepts—it connects words and structures based on what it learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Goal:**\n",
    "Lay out clear **breadcrumbs** (specific clues, context, roles, and formats) so the model pulls the right information from its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Core Components of an Effective Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) **Be Specific and Context-Rich**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vague: *“Summarize this paper.”*\n",
    "* Better: *“Summarize this neuroscience paper in 200 words, highlighting the main hypothesis, methods, and conclusions for a graduate-level audience.”*\n",
    "* Specify: topic + domain + length + target level + focus areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) **Define the Target Audience**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model adjusts tone and vocabulary based on the audience.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  *“Explain quantum entanglement to a high-school student using analogies and simple language.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c) **Specify the Output Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask for the structure you need.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  *“Create a table comparing the effects of climate change on agriculture in three countries using peer-reviewed data.”*\n",
    "  Formats can be: table, list, figure, paragraph, or code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (d) **Assign a Role**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Telling the model *who* it is improves quality and tone.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  *“You are an academic journal editor. Rewrite this abstract to meet publishing standards and improve clarity.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### (e) **Add Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit what the model includes or excludes.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  *“Write a 300-word summary focusing only on the methodology. Avoid background information or future directions.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### (f) **Break the Task into Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For complex academic or reasoning tasks, guide the AI step-by-step.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Summarize the article.\n",
    "  2. Revise it for an academic conference abstract (250 words).\n",
    "  3. Simplify language for a non-specialist audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (g) **Control the Tone and Style**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Direct the AI to use an appropriate tone.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  *“Rewrite this paragraph in an academic tone using active voice and hedging statements like ‘it appears’ or ‘the data suggests.’”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### (h) **Remove Fluff**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid filler phrases like “please” or “thank you.”\n",
    "  They don’t improve responses and may soften the tone unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) **Provide Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Giving examples helps the model mimic tone, structure, or logic.\n",
    "  Example prompt pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Read this and say “read when done.”\n",
    "  [Insert examples of abstracts/tables]\n",
    "  Using what you just read, create a new abstract on [topic].\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This method helps AI mirror style and structure effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (j) **Tune Parameters (Temperature)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **temperature: 0 →** precise, rule-following, factual.\n",
    "* **temperature: 1 →** creative, varied, less predictable.\n",
    "* Adjust depending on the task (e.g., factual = 0 ; creative writing = 0.7–1).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "### What It Is\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasoning method that adds **intermediate logical steps** between question → answer, helping LLMs handle tasks requiring arithmetic, logic, or reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Learning:** Provide one or more examples showing the task.\n",
    "  Example (One-Shot):\n",
    "  *“I have 3 tennis balls. I get 3 more. How many do I have? 6.”*\n",
    "  → Then ask your question.\n",
    "* **Chain-of-Thought (Reasoning):** Add reasoning before the final answer.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  *“I start with 3 tennis balls and get 3 more. 3 + 3 = 6. So the answer is 6.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question → Reasoning Steps → Final Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guides model step-by-step like human reasoning.\n",
    "* Improves performance on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Arithmetic problems\n",
    "  * Common-sense reasoning tasks\n",
    "* Allows high accuracy without fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "* For large models (100B+ parameters), Chain-of-Thought prompting can match or surpass fine-tuned models for reasoning tasks—while using fewer resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Best Practices from OpenAI’s Official Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Use the Latest Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Newer models = better reasoning and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Place Instructions at the Beginning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use separators like `###` or triple quotes for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Summarize the text below as bullet points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text: \"\"\"\n",
    "{your text here}\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Be Descriptive and Detailed**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify all aspects: **context**, **goal**, **length**, **tone**, **format**, **audience**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Show Desired Output Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "Models perform better when shown the expected structure.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Company names: <list>\n",
    "People names: <list>\n",
    "Topics: <list>\n",
    "Themes: <list>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Zero-Shot → Few-Shot → Fine-Tune (in this order)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot:** Just the instruction.\n",
    "* **Few-Shot:** Add examples.\n",
    "* **Fine-Tune:** Only when zero-/few-shot fail for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Avoid Vague Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of:\n",
    "❌ *“Fairly short, a few sentences only.”*\n",
    "✅ *“Write a 3–5 sentence paragraph.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Use Positive Guidance (Tell What to Do)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of only restrictions:\n",
    "❌ *“Do not ask username or password.”*\n",
    "✅ *“Diagnose the issue and suggest a solution. Refer to the help article instead of asking for PII.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **For Code Prompts — Use “Leading Words”**\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain cues help the model identify task type.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Write a Python function that converts miles to kilometers.\n",
    "import\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(“import” signals Python code generation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Leverage ‘Generate Anything’ Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe your task → get a well-formed AI-optimized prompt automatically.\n",
