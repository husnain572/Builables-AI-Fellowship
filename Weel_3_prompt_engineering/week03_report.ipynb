Note the crucial fact: **every label is wrong**.<br>2. Pick **one fruit from the box labeled “Mixed.”** — that box must be only apples or only oranges.<br>3. Two possible outcomes:<br>  - If you draw an **apple**, the box labeled “Mixed” is the **Apples** box. The box labeled **“Apples”** must be **Oranges**, and the box labeled **“Oranges”** is **Mixed**.<br>  - If you draw an **orange**, the box labeled “Mixed” is the **Oranges** box. The box labeled **“Oranges”** must be **Apples**, and the box labeled **“Apples”** is **Mixed**.<br>4. Therefore, one fruit from the box labeled “Mixed” lets you determine the correct contents of all three boxes. |\n",
